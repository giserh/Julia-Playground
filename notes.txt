Interesting parameters:
	- Nearest-neighbor epsilon
	- Seed points
	- Distance metric
	- Color source
	- Array order (or, more generally, sampling method)
	- Interactive control of colors, seeds, placement

Things to visualize
	- If it's an image, see the colors in the image and animate their movement to the canvas
	- See the points on the frontier in 3d (rgb)

Ideas
	- When placing points onto the canvas, color them by the time at which they were placed, or the size of the frontier as they're being placed
